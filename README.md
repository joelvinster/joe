Diabetes Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes using the Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used is a structured CSV file containing medical attributes relevant to diabetes diagnosis.

Dataset

The dataset used is diabetes.csv, which consists of multiple features such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (Target Variable: 0 - Non-Diabetic, 1 - Diabetic)

Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

Training a Random Forest Classifier

Evaluating the model using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix

Interactive user input to predict diabetes based on user-provided medical data
